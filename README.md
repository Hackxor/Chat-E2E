# Chat-E2E
Simple chat made in Tkinter, with the purpose of practicing with the SOCKET, THREADS functions and use of widgets in said interface.

Messaging encryption (E2E) was also added, so that a man in the middle attack cannot be carried out, you can check this by viewing the traffic with wireshark.
